# WoWAuctionParser
Scans auction house data from World of Warcraft. Eventually there will be a web interface where users can enter which items they want, what their price threshold is, and which realm they are on. The system will email them if there is an item on their realm matching their criteria on the auction house.

Mostly this is a project to learn Python, MySQL, and Django.
